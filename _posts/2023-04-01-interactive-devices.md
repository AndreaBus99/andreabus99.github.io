#### Creative documentation

The Boombox is a device that sends data back to a laptop for both visualization and sonification. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make some kind of sonification. At first, I was only working on the technical part of it and getting it working with a continuous beeping sound. I had no idea what to create for my enclosure. Until one Friday night, I was watching the movie “Say Something,” and saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GoH3M9Kb4g"> scene</a> where Lloyd holds a boombox above his head and plays a song outside Diane’s window.

This is where my creative vision came from. I changed the beeping sound to one of my favorite songs from the past few weeks, “Last words” by Kenny Beats. You can check the song I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxt_H7e38E"> here</a>, and also a Tiny Desk Concert of Kenny Beats <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPRVzA67Dbs"> here</a>, he starts explaining the song at around minute 3:00. In order to make the enclosure, I used a shoe box I had and designed a boombox using illustrator. I made it more colorful since I feel like it goes better with the song. Then I made the openings for the joystick and the button.

To make it more fun, with the joystick you can control the pitch of the song by moving it up and down on the x-axis. If you click the button on the joystick you can repeat the song from the beginning. And there is an additional button that when you hold it the music stops playing. Other than the fact that I chose “Last words” because I really like the song, I also chose it because the female voice is really high pitched, so when controlling the pitch you would get very interesting and fun sounds. Finally, I also decided to include the screen of my laptop in the overall system to display the waveforms created. Instead of only adding one simple line that represents the waveform, I added 10 lines so that it fills the entire screen. I also adjusted some of the widths of these lines so that it creates different patterns. It was really cool to see how the waveforms changed as you adjusted the pitch. I hope you like it!
