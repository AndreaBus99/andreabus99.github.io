## Infinity Mirror

Take a look at the code and technical documentation <a href="https://github.com/AndreaBus99/CES-technical-documentation/tree/main/Infinity%20Lamp">here</a>.

#### Creative documentation

The Infinity Mirror is a project using LED lights and two sets of mirrors. This project was inspired by a dodecahedron infinity lamp one of my friends has in her apartment. I wanted to buy one of these a while ago for my brother who really likes lights and patterns. However, they are really expensive. Given the opportunity of this project, I decided to make something similar. My initial idea was to make a dodecahedron with LED strips on each edge, but this meant a lot of soldering in difficult angles. Since I am no pro in soldering, I decided to tone it down to either a cube or the one I ended up doing. In the end, the “tunnel-like” lamp was much cooler, at least in my opinion.

In order for this to work, we need a normal mirror and a one-way mirror. The light will bounce between the two mirrors creating this illusion. You can check the technical documentation to better understand the process! For the materials, I decided to use an acrylic mirror and a clear acrylic sheet with a one-way window film, as these were cheaper options. For the enclosure of the lamp, I also used acrylic because I wanted it to have a clean and clear finish.

<br>
During the process, I had some technical difficulties with the acrylic. You have to be very careful when using acrylic as it gets scratched very easily. Also, I was first using white glue, but this was taking a lot of time to dry. For gluing acrylic I recommend super glue (but do not use too much as it will stain the acrylic). Another technical difficulty I had was putting the one-way mirror film into the clear acrylic sheet as I accidentally bought one that was non-adhesive and was more difficult to install. So, I recommend getting a film that is adhesive so that the process is easier. Other than these, just trust the process as you go.

To turn it on and off, I used a switch button. This way you can control when you want your lamp to be turned off. The button is on the right side of the mirror. Instead of keeping it in only one color, I also included a few different patterns of lights, once turned on, these will loop over and over. I explored different patterns and chose the ones that were more intriguing to me. The idea is that either you can use it as a mirror and put it up on the wall, or also use it as a lamp. As it has a lot of patterns, it acts more like a “disco ball” and not so much as a reading lamp. It's a lamp for dancing!

<br>
Overall the process was not very rewarding until I finally added the mirrors and could see the final product. I had a lot of fun creating and documenting this project!

For the documentation, I chose to add the song "What is Love" by Haddaway because it is a song that always makes me want to dance and looks great with the patterns.
