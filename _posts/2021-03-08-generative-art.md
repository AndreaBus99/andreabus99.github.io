#### Creative documentation

On this project, I took the opportunity to create a visual representation of what my commute (or maybe everyone's commute) feels like. It takes about 55 minutes from the moment I step outside of my apartment to the moment I arrive at my university. Sometimes time flies by, other times it seems like it takes forever. I listed all of the stations I pass by on my journey in one long sentence, and then I programmed it so that it scrolls horizontally. It takes about 2 minutes for the ESP32 to show the 21 stations, from Myrtle-Willoughby to 116th street Columbia University. I did a small experiment while testing this out. When I was just looking at the device for it to finish showing the entire text, I felt like it was never going to end. However, when I put on some music or read a book, time passed a lot faster. This is what commuting feels like. In the video, I added some music so that you can get a more clear sense of my goal. 

I had a few technical difficulties when doing this project. First of all, we were supposed to power the ESP32 by using a battery. However, when I was soldering the battery cables, the battery started smoking. So I could not really use it. In the end, there was some change of plans on how the installation was going to be. The original idea was to hang the ESP32 in a public space; however, since there were some issues with the batteries, we connected our ESP32 to a small board. Although it was a more intimate and small installation, I felt that it captured the creative vision that went into doing this project. Also, all of our devices were close together, so it felt like a more communal and integrated project. I hope you like it!
