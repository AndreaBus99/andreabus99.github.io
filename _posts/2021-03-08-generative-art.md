## Generative Art: My commute to uni

#### Creative documentation

On this project, I took the opportunity to create a visual representation of what my commute (or maybe everyone's commute) feels like. It takes about 55 minutes from the moment I step outside of my apartment to the moment I arrive at my university. Sometimes time flies by, other times it seems like it takes forever. I listed all of the stations I pass by on my journey in one long sentence, and then I programmed it so that it scrolls horizontally. The orientation of the text is horizontal so that you have more time to read it while it is scrolling. It takes about 2 minutes for the ESP32 to show the 21 stations, from Myrtle-Willoughby to 116th street Columbia University. I did a small experiment while testing this out. When I was just looking at the device for it to finish showing the entire text, I felt like it was never going to end. However, when I put on some music or read a book, time passed a lot faster. This is what commuting feels like. In the video, I added some music so that you can get a more clear sense of my goal. 

I had a few technical difficulties when doing this project. First of all, we were supposed to power the ESP32 by using a battery. However, when I was soldering the battery cables, the battery started smoking. So I could not really use it. In the end, there was a change of plans on how the installation was going to be. The original idea was to hang the ESP32 in a public space; however, since there were some issues with the batteries, we connected our ESP32 to a small board to power our devices on. Although it was a more intimate and small installation, I felt that it captured the creative vision that went into doing this project. Also, all of our devices were close together, so it felt like a more communal and integrated project. I hope you like it!
